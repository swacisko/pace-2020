# pace-2020

**ExTREEm** - heuristic solver for treedepth problem, written as an entry to the PACE 2020 challenge.

A set of heuristics is used to find elimination tree of given graph, with height as small as possible.<br>
The main algorithm works in iterations, in each iteration a new treedepth decomposition is found (iterations are independent from each other, the longer the solver runs, the more iterations are done and the greater chance of finding a good decomposition).<br>



<br>


**Requirements**:

CMake VERSION 3.10.2 or higher<br>
c++ 17 or higher

<br>

**Installation**:

Use cmake to obtain a binary file, e.g. in linux in the main directory (pace-2020) you can use the following commands:

mkdir build<br>
cd build<br>
cmake ..<br>
make

After this, the executable file name "ExTREEm" should be in the "build" directory

<br>

**Usage:**

Given a graph in a file graph.gr, you can run ExTREEm in the following way
 
./ExTREEm < example_input.gr > example_output.out 2>example_logs.err


ExTREEm will run until it receives SIGTERM signal (e.g. using "kill -s SIGTERM $pid" command in linux).<br>
For small graphs (e.g. 50 vertices) large logs may be created. In case you intend to run ExTREEm on small instances for a very long time, you may consider not to keep stderr in a file.
